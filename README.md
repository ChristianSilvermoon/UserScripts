### [Derpibooru Header Search Plus](https://github.com/ChristianSilvermoon/UserScripts/raw/master/derpibooru.org/Derpibooru%20Header%20Search%20Plus.user.js)
This somewhat hacky script attempts to append the **Sort Order** and **Sort Method** dropdowns from the *bottom* of the Derpibooru page to the top bar.

It is not garaunteed to look pretty, but means you can avoid scrolling all the way down to access these functionalities.
